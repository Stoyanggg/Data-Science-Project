This project aims to predict customer satisfaction scores using regression models and then using classification methods to predict binary satisfaction labels (0 and 1). The dataset includes the following columns:

id
age
gender
income
education
region
loyalty_status
purchase_frequency
purchase_amount
product_category
promotion_usage
satisfaction_score



Overview
The goal of this project is to build predictive models for customer satisfaction using various regression and classification algorithms. We start by predicting the satisfaction scores as continuous values and then transform the scores into binary labels (0 and 1) for further classification analysis.
